Subject: Zil Money: Transition Complete, Profitable & Scaling (112%+ NRR)

Hi [Investor Name],

I wanted to share a quick update on Zil Money. We have successfully completed our transition from a transactional model to a sticky, high-margin financial operating system for SMBs.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Revenue Recovery:** We are back to unlimited capacity following our planned credit rail transition.
- **Strong Retention:** Our core products are demonstrating exceptional Net Revenue Retention (NRR), validating our "land and expand" strategy:
  - **Embedded Payments:** 124.7% NRR
  - **Credit Rail:** 112.5% NRR
  - **Wallet:** 108.3% NRR
- **Growth:** +42.8% revenue growth over the last 6 months.

**The Opportunity:**
We are raising $10M to scale our growth marketing and hire a dedicated enterprise sales team. With our compliance framework solidified (partnerships with Lincoln Savings Bank & Texas National Bank) and a proven product-market fit, we are ready to accelerate.

Best,

CEO, Zil Money
