Subject: Zil Money: The Financial OS for SMBs (Profitable, +42% Growth & 112%+ NRR)

Hi [Investor Name],

I’m writing to introduce Zil Money, the financial operating system designed to empower modern small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). We provide a unified platform that simplifies payroll, payables, and receivables, allowing businesses to manage their cash flow with unprecedented control and efficiency.

We have successfully completed our strategic transition from a transactional model to a sticky, high-margin ecosystem. This shift is driving significant momentum, with **+42.8% revenue growth** over the last 6 months and strong Net Revenue Retention (NRR) across our core product lines:
- **Embedded Payments:** 124.7% NRR
- **Credit Rail:** 112.5% NRR
- **Wallet:** 108.3% NRR

With our compliance framework solidified through partnerships with Lincoln Savings Bank and Texas National Bank, and a proven product-market fit, we are now raising $10M to scale our growth marketing and expand our enterprise sales team.

Our detailed financial model, KPIs, and audited statements are available upon request. I’d love to connect and discuss how we are reshaping SMB finance. Are you available for a brief call next Tuesday or Thursday?

Best,

[Founder Name]
CEO, Zil Money
