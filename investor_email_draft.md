Subject: Zil Money: The Financial OS for SMBs (Profitable, $6.5M ARR & 135%+ NRR)

Hi [Investor Name],

I’m writing to introduce Zil Money, the financial operating system designed to empower modern small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). We provide a unified platform that simplifies payroll, payables, and receivables, allowing businesses to manage their cash flow with unprecedented control and efficiency.

We are currently transitioning from a transactional model to a sticky, high-margin ecosystem. This strategic shift is already driving significant momentum: we are **profitable** and operating at a **$6.5M annualized revenue run-rate**, with **+42.8% revenue growth** over the last 6 months.

Our core product lines are demonstrating strong Net Revenue Retention (NRR), validating our "land and expand" strategy:
- **Embedded Payments:** 134.3% NRR
- **Credit Rail:** 145.2% NRR (New Cohorts)
- **Wallet:** 125.9% NRR (New Cohorts)

With our compliance framework solidified through partnerships with Lincoln Savings Bank and Texas National Bank, and a proven product-market fit, we are now raising $10M to scale our growth marketing and expand our enterprise sales team.
